sdt-python is a collection of tools for analysis of fluorescence microscopy
data.

It contains
- algorithms for localization of fluorescent features in images
- methods for evaluation of tracking data
- functions to evaluate brightness data
- support for automated determination and correction of chromatic aberrations
- methods for reading and writing single molecule data in various formats
- handling of ROIs (both rectangular and described by arbitrary paths)
- methods for simulation of fluorescence microscopy images
- much more.
